# SD700 repository delivery policy

GitHub `main` is the source of truth. After a validated software change:

1. Run applicable builds/tests and strict firmware verification.
2. Keep the current field HEX/ELF tracked, with README and firmware manifests accurate.
3. Update the root tracked-source SHA256 manifest when tracked files change.
4. Commit and push `origin/main` through a normal fast-forward update.

Delivery is the pushed commit. Do not generate ZIPs, tarballs, source/review
bundles, archive hash sidecars, extracted-package copies or nested deliveries.
Do not add a package-verification prerequisite for field use. This policy
supersedes historical packaging instructions in engineering records.

Field checkouts use `git switch main`, `git pull --ff-only`, `git rev-parse HEAD`,
then `python tools/verify_force_servo_firmware.py`. Use the current repository
firmware identified by README and `Firmware/ForceServo1.SHA256SUMS.txt`.

Preserve unique field evidence and useful historical engineering records.
Inspect generated directories before removing them. Retain useful test logs;
remove regenerable objects, caches, temporary build trees and duplicate outputs.
Never use `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fdx` or force push for cleanup/delivery.

The current field candidate is Target250MVP1, an explicitly supervised Target250
sensor-unit ForceServo session. Keep the existing 0.5 A field current limit.
Default ForceServo builds remain compiled LOCKED. The existing explicit real
output flag is reused by -Target250MVP1; do not create a runtime unlock bypass.
Keep STOP priority, independent lease/freshness stop, raw overpressure, output
caps, direction interlock and no automatic restart. Software PASS is not physical
validation. Follow only the current README field procedure.

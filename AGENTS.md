# SD700 repository delivery policy

GitHub `main` is the source of truth. After a validated software change:

1. Run applicable builds/tests and strict firmware verification.
2. Keep the current field HEX/ELF tracked, with README and firmware manifests accurate.
3. Update the root tracked-source SHA256 manifest when tracked files change.
4. Commit and push `origin/main` through a normal fast-forward update.

Delivery is the pushed commit. Do not generate ZIPs, tarballs, source/review
bundles, archive hash sidecars, extracted-package copies or nested deliveries.
Do not add a package-verification prerequisite for field use. This policy
supersedes historical packaging instructions in engineering records.

Field checkouts use `git switch main`, `git pull --ff-only`, `git rev-parse HEAD`,
then `python tools/verify_force_servo_firmware.py`. Use the current repository
firmware identified by README and `Firmware/ForceServo1.SHA256SUMS.txt`.

Preserve unique field evidence and useful historical engineering records.
Inspect generated directories before removing them. Retain useful test logs;
remove regenerable objects, caches, temporary build trees and duplicate outputs.
Never use `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fdx` or force push for cleanup/delivery.

The current ForceServo1 physical output remains compiled LOCKED. Repository
cleanup or delivery changes must not alter PID, trajectory, executor, TIM5,
HOLD, limits or safety behavior. Software PASS is not physical validation.
